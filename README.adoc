= Mach

Mach is a remake of make, striving to keep the good parts.

== Design goals

* Fast start-up (ideally sub-second)
* Incremental builds (only do necessary work)
* Sane language (avoid make's horrible syntax and language features)
* Support rules and extensibility

For the language, we have chosen ClojureScript because it is clean,
consistent, expressive and powerful. Machfiles as data, using the EDN
format.

Mach sits on the extensive nodejs eco-system. If you need to do anything
remotely complex, feel free to pick from the quarter-million-plus
modules available to you.

== Status

Mach is in alpha status. You are encouraged to use it if you are
prepared to accept some changes if you upgrade.

== Installing Mach

Install Mach with NPM like this

....
$ sudo npm install -g @juxt/mach
....

Mach uses `boot` to resolve dependencies mentioned in the Machfile, so
you might want to install [`boot-clj`](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot)
while your at it.

Mach ships with https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo[Lumo] 1.7.0.

== Getting started

Create a simple project and add a Machfile.edn file. The Machfile is a
simple map, modelled in a similar fashion to the original Makefile,
with targets as keys and dependencies/actions as values.

Your very first Machfile.edn might look like this:

[source,clojure]
----
{
 hallo (println "Guten Tag, Welt!")
}
----

You can invoke Mach with the following:

....
$ mach hallo
....

to get the following output:

....
Guten Tag, Welt!
....

== Try it out

Clone the mach project.

....
$ git clone https://github.com/juxt/mach
$ cd mach/examples/app
....

Try the following:

....
$ mach target
....

This creates a directory called `target`.

Try again.

....
$ mach target
....

Since `target` already exists, you should get the following output:

....
Nothing to do!
....

Now try this:

....
$ mach css
....

If you have the SASS compiler installed, `sassc`, this will compile the
sass files in `sass` to `target/app.css`.

== Targets

Machfile entries have target names (the keys) and targets (actions or
maps which describe when and how to build the target).

If you use a map, you can put anything you like in this map, but a few
of these keys are special and are described below. Try to avoid using
lowercase non-namespaced symbols, since these are reserved by Mach and
some of these are discussed below.

=== depends

The `depends` entry contains a list of targets that must be updated (if
stale) prior to this target being considered for update.

[source,clojure]
----
{jar {description "A jar file containing Java classes and CSS"
      depends [classes css]}}
----

A `depends` is simply a sequence of targets to check.

=== product

The product of a target is the file (or files) that it produces. If you
declare this with the special symbol `product` it will assist the
'auto-clean' feature of Mach.

=== novelty

Deciding whether a target is stale (requiring a re-build) or fresh (no
re-build is necessary) might be a simple procedure or a complex
computation. Regardless, Mach asks you to provide a predicate, written
in ClojureScript to determine whether or not a target is stale.

Mach provides a built-in predicate to determine if any files in a given
directory have been modified with respect to a given file.

The signature of this function is:

[source,clojure]
----
(mach.core/modified-since [file dir])
----

The first argument is the file with which all files in the second
argument (directory) are compared against. If any file in the directory
has been modified more recently than the file in the first argument, the
predicate returns true.

For example:

[source,clojure]
----
{css {novelty (mach.core/modified-since "target/app.css" "sass")}}
----

It is also possible to express this target like this:

[source,clojure]
----
{css {target "target/app.css"
      novelty (mach.core/modified-since target "sass")}}
----

This illustrates that symbols in ClojureScript expressions are resolved
with respect to the given map, which defines the scope for all
expressions. This allows you to surface key values as declarations,
accessible from within local ClojureScript expressions and also exposed
to other tools. These values are also accessible by other targets, via
references (see below).

=== update!

If novelty is detected, a target is updated by calling the `update!`
function. The terminology here is intended to align with our
https://github.com/juxt/skip[skip] project.

The `update!` expression must do whatever is necessary to rebuild
(freshen) the target.

[source,clojure]
----
{css {target "target/app.css"
      novelty (mach.core/modified-since target #ref [sass dir])
      update! (apply mach.core/sh (concat ["sassc"] novelty [">" target]))}}
----

In the `update!` expression can be side-effecting (and should be!).
Often, an `update!` expression will reference the value of `novelty` to
reduce work.

=== produce

As an alternative to `update!`, a target can declare a `produce` entry.
This should produce output that is normally written to the `product`
file.

== Verbs

A target can optionally be called with a verb.

For example:

....
mach pdf:clean
....

=== clean

This calls the `pdf` target with the `clean` verb, which removes any
files created by the target (declared in `product`).

=== update

This calls the `update!` (or `produce`) expressions, regardless of
whether the target if fresh or not. No dependencies are called.

=== print

For targets that have a `produce`, this is called and output is sent to
the console instead of the `product`.

=== Implicit clean

Since derived files are declared with `product`, Mach is able to
automatically determine how to clean a target. Therefore, you don't need
to specify a special rule, conventionally called `clean`, to clean up
derived files.

== Additional Features

=== Calling out to the shell

One of the best design decisions in the original Make tool was to
integrate closely with the Unix shell. There are countless operations
that are accessible via the shell, and Mach strives to encourage this
usage via its custom EDN tag literal `#$`.

`clojure {hello-internal (println "Hello World!")  hello-external #$ ["echo Hello!"]}`

The `#$` tag literal is a short-cut to the built-in Mach function
`mach.core/sh`.

=== References

Make makes heavy use of _variables_, in the spirit of DRY (Don't Repeat
Yourself). Often, this leads to obfuscation, variables are defined in
terms of other variables, and so on.

Mach achieves DRY without endless indirection by using references (the
same way https://github.com/juxt/aero[Aero] does it) - key values can be
declared in a target and referenced from other parts of the Machfile,
via the `#ref` tag literal.

[source,clojure]
----
{
src {dir "src"}
classes {update! (compile #ref [src dir])}
}
----

The `#ref` tag must be followed by a vector of symbols which target the
required value.

=== Using ClojureScript dependencies

You can use other ClojureScript libraries in your Machfile, for example

[source,clojure]
----
{
mach/dependencies [[aero "1.1.2"]]
print-config (println (aero.core/read-config "config.edn" {}))
}
----

The `dependencies` directive uses https://github.com/boot-clj/boot[Boot] to
fetch Maven dependencies and to inject these dependencies directly
onto the Lumo/Mach classpath. Note, Boot is only invoked when the
declared dependencies vector has changed.

For this to work therefore you must have Boot installed (version 2.7.1
or above), and at least https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo[Lumo]
1.3.0.

Note that Mach auto-requires namespaces, so in this example we do not
need `(require 'aero.core)`.

=== Add to the Lumo/Mach classpath

You can add artbitrary directories and files to the Mach/Lumo classpath using the `cp` literal, for example:

[source,clojure]
----
{
add-cp #cp "some-dir-containing-cljs"
}
----

=== Mach Extensions

Mach extensions allow us to create reusable tasks, using the
`mach/import` directive. For example:

[source,clojure]
----
{
mach/import [["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juxt/mach/master/extensions/aws.mach.edn" {profile "some-profile"}]]
}
----

Importing the AWS extension as above adds to Mach AWS utility targets such as 'ips' which  lists the IPs of running EC2 instances. To execute this imported task, simply: `mach ips`.

For more examples of extensions, checkout the link:extensions/aws.mach.edn[AWS extension] for AWS utility tasks.

==== Aliasing Extensions

[source,clojure]
----
{
mach/import [["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juxt/mach/master/extensions/aws.mach.edn" {profile "some-profile"} :as aws]]
}
----

The above will import all tasks under the namespace aws. From the command line you would now execute `mach aws/ips`.

You can also rename tasks when importing:

[source,clojure]
----
{
mach/import [["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juxt/mach/master/extensions/aws.mach.edn" {profile "some-profile"} :rename ips ips2]]
}
----

From the command line you would now execute `mach ips2`.

==== Using local extension files

[source,clojure]
----
{
mach/import [[foo {}]]
}
----

In this case Mach will search this current directory - and also parent directories - for an extension file called foo.mach.edn. Once the extensions file is found Mach will load the extension targets. `refer` and `rename` can also be used to change the namespace/symbol of the imported target respectively.

Furthermore, any symbols in the target extension can be rewritten based on the supplied map of args. For example if the bar target was coded as such:

== Acknowledgements

Mach is built on https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo[lumo] by Ant√≥nio
Nuno Monteiro.

== Sprichst Du Deutsch?

Since you ask, the name is from the German verb, _machen_ (to do, to
make), used in the imperative. Mach is as much about 'doing' as
'making', which the German verb captures well.

== Influences

Mach is influenced by Make, particularly GNU Make, which has survived
the test of time (but not without baggage).

I also looked at Jake, which is a worthy re-implementation of Make,
sticking close to the original. Also, https://ninja-build.org/[Ninja]
and http://gittup.org/tup/make_vs_tup.html[Tup].

Paul deGrandis https://github.com/juxt/mach/issues/3[suggested] it was a
good idea to look at https://swtch.com/plan9port/man/man1/mk.html[Mk],
which has influenced the verbs and 'auto-clean' features.

== Road map

The goal of Mach is to create something that is capable of building
complex systems as well as running them. One option is to use Mach to
generate a classpath from a project.clj (`lein classpath`) and use that
to run Clojure applications with java directly, avoiding the use of lein
and its associated memory costs. It might also be possible to make more
judicious use of AOT to speed things are further - by utilising
file-system dates, it is possible to detect staleness and fix it when
necessary - say if a project.clj is determined to be newer then the
classpath can be regenerated.

== Development

To test locally set `$MACH_HOME` to the directory containing your local copy of
this directory. If you're in it, you can do this:

[source,shell]
----
export MACH_HOME="$(pwd)"
----

If you have a globally installed mach, it will run the one in this directory
whilst that environment variable is set.

If you have modified the `bin/mach` file, you will need to call it directly, as
well as setting `$MACH_HOME`
